            <p>This pencil sketch of the Mona Lisa was created over a span of several months, from December 10, 2024, to March 23, 2024. Although the sketch remains incomplete, I have decided to accept it as a completed work. Throughout the process, I aimed to capture the essence, emotion, and timeless beauty of Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece, rather than focusing solely on perfecting every detail.<br><br>

                As I worked on this piece, I encountered moments of challenge and reflection, which helped me understand the depth and complexity behind the original painting. Every line, shade, and unfinished space tells a part of my creative journey. Instead of striving for flawlessness, I embraced the imperfections and allowed the sketch to reflect the natural flow of my hand and thoughts at the time.<br><br>
                
                This artwork represents more than just a technical exercise; it symbolizes my growth as an artist, my patience, and my willingness to accept that sometimes, beauty lies within the unfinished and the imperfect. Through this sketch, I hope to convey a sense of respect for the original masterpiece while also showcasing my personal interpretation and artistic process.</p>

            <p>This pencil sketch was created between August 22, 2023, and September 16, 2023, as a thoughtful birthday gift for Bandana Bhatta. The intention behind the sketch was to capture a simple yet meaningful representation, reflecting a personal connection through art. Although the artwork was completed within the designated time frame, it has not yet been delivered due to unforeseen circumstances.<br><br>

                The sketch was carefully crafted with attention to detail, focusing on expression and subtlety rather than intricate precision. While it remains with me for now, the original purpose of the piece remains unchanged — to offer a meaningful, hand-drawn gift that conveys thoughtfulness and effort. Despite its current unfinished chapter in this journey, I look forward to the day it reaches its intended recipient, where it will hopefully evoke the same emotions and care with which it was created.</p>

            <p>This pencil sketch, completed between March and April 2025, is a self-portrait that marks a significant milestone in my artistic journey. It is, by far, the most realistic sketch I have ever created. With a focus on capturing the finer details of my features and expression, I strived to push the boundaries of my technical skills. This piece showcases my growing ability to translate a real-life image into an intricate, lifelike representation using only pencil and paper. The drawing reflects both my dedication to improving my craft and my desire to create a more personal and realistic depiction of myself.<br><br>

                The process of creating this self-portrait was both challenging and rewarding. I took extra care in observing the subtle play of light and shadow on my face, something I had never fully explored in previous works. Every line and shading choice was carefully considered, as I aimed to reflect not only the visual likeness but also the emotion and character behind the image. This sketch is a personal achievement, symbolizing the progress I have made as an artist and my commitment to continually refining my skills.<br><br>
                
                While this self-portrait is an example of technical growth, it also serves as a reminder of the importance of self-reflection in the creative process. By drawing myself, I found a deeper connection to the art I create, seeing both my strengths and areas for improvement. It has reinforced my belief in the power of practice, patience, and the willingness to embrace challenges as opportunities for growth.</p>

        <p>This pencil sketch of Mother Teresa was created between December 2022 and January 2023, during the early stages of my artistic journey. Although it was one of the first sketches I attempted, it still holds a sense of realism that surprised me at the time. The drawing reflects my initial exploration of portraiture, where I aimed to capture not just the likeness of such a renowned figure, but also the essence of her compassion and gentle spirit.<br><br>

            Even though it was created during the beginning phase of my sketching experience, this piece stands as one of my most impressive works from that period. The challenge of portraying Mother Teresa, someone known for her profound humanity, pushed me to focus on the subtleties of her expression, the softness of her features, and the emotion conveyed through her gaze. Despite being an early attempt, the sketch has retained a surprising degree of realism, marking a significant moment of growth in my artistic journey.<br><br>
            
            Reflecting on this sketch today, I realize it also represents a moment of transformation for me as an artist. It was during the process of drawing Mother Teresa that I began to understand the importance of capturing not just the visual likeness but the deeper, emotional essence of the subject. This sketch is a reminder of how far I’ve come in a short amount of time and serves as a testament to the power of dedication, even in the early stages of learning.</p>

        <p>This pencil sketch of Valak, the infamous demon from The Conjuring 2, was created in September 2022. The drawing captures the unsettling and eerie presence of the character, focusing on the chilling details that define Valak’s menacing appearance. Inspired by the iconic portrayal in the film, I aimed to bring out the dark intensity and haunting expression that made the character so memorable.<br><br>

            Working on this piece presented a unique challenge, as it required me to capture not just the physical features of the character, but also the sinister atmosphere associated with it. The contrast between light and shadow played a crucial role in bringing out the eerie, almost lifelike quality of the sketch. Despite the character’s frightening nature, I found the process of creating the artwork both intriguing and rewarding, as it pushed me to experiment with different shading techniques and capture a more dramatic level of detail than I had previously attempted.<br><br>
            
            This sketch of Valak not only stands as a study of dark imagery and film-inspired art but also marks an important step in my journey as an artist, experimenting with different themes and exploring the intersection between horror and realism. It represents a moment of growth in my ability to handle challenging subjects and create compelling, atmospheric art.</p>

            This sketch of Prithvi Narayan Shah, the first King of unified Nepal, was drawn during the initial days of my artistic journey, in 2021. Created using a combination of charcoal pencil and colored pencil, this piece represents one of my early attempts at portraiture and historical representation. Although the artwork may not reflect the level of refinement I strive for today, it still holds significant emotional value for me.<br><br>

            At the time of its creation, I was experimenting with different mediums and techniques, and while the result may not be perfect, the sketch carries with it a sense of respect and admiration for Prithvi Narayan Shah. His legacy as a unifier of Nepal is reflected in the emotional connection I felt while drawing. Despite its imperfections, this piece is an honest representation of my early efforts, capturing both my struggles and my passion for the subject. It is a reminder of how much I’ve grown as an artist and how important it is to embrace the emotional journey behind every artwork, even when the outcome is not flawless.<br><br>

            This drawing of a cow baby, the national animal of Nepal, was created in 2023. The artwork captures the innocence and gentle nature of the calf, reflecting its significance as a symbol of strength and reverence in Nepali culture. The background was created using sinepen colors in a block pattern, adding a vibrant, contemporary touch to the piece, while the calf itself was drawn with traditional gray pencil, focusing on the softness and texture of the young animal's fur.<br><br>

            The contrast between the bold, colorful background and the realistic portrayal of the calf emphasizes the simplicity and purity of the subject. While the calf remains the focal point, the background provides an interesting dynamic that enhances the overall composition. This drawing represents my ongoing exploration of blending traditional techniques with modern styles, as well as my deep respect for the cultural symbolism tied to the cow in Nepal. Though simple in design, this piece holds personal significance and reflects my growth as an artist.

            This vector-style illustration of a tiger was created in 2024 using a black gel pen. The sharp lines and bold contrast of the black ink give the tiger a fierce, yet elegant presence, capturing the strength and majesty of this iconic animal. The clean, geometric approach to the design emphasizes the tiger's dynamic form, while the minimalistic style enhances its powerful silhouette.<br><br>

The use of gel pen adds a distinct texture to the piece, with each line contributing to the intricate details that define the tiger's features, from its piercing eyes to the bold stripes across its body. While the image leans into modern, graphic aesthetics, it still retains a sense of natural realism through the precision of the lines and shading.<br><br>

This drawing represents my exploration of digital-inspired design techniques using traditional tools, focusing on the balance between nature and the boldness of modern artistic expression. The tiger, a symbol of strength and courage, reflects my growth as an artist and my ability to fuse different styles to communicate powerful imagery.

            This vector-style drawing of Lord Mahadeva was created in August 2024. Using a gel pen, I focused on capturing the divine energy of Mahadeva through flowing, minimalistic strokes. The artwork aims to reflect both the power and serenity associated with Mahadeva, balancing strong, bold lines with softer curves to represent the harmony between strength and peace. The choice of using simple black strokes highlights the timelessness of the figure, allowing the sacred essence of the subject to come forward without any distractions.<br><br>

            The clean, stroke-based approach gives the drawing a modern, almost meditative feeling, blending traditional religious symbolism with a contemporary art style. Each line was placed thoughtfully to maintain a sense of movement and fluidity, symbolizing the eternal and ever-present nature of Mahadeva. Though minimal in design, the piece carries deep spiritual meaning for me and represents my exploration of combining sacred imagery with modern vector-inspired techniques. This artwork marks an important moment in my growth, where faith, tradition, and artistic evolution intersect on paper.

            This charcoal pencil drawing of the Joker from Batman was created between March and May of 2023. The piece captures the chaotic energy and dark persona of the iconic villain, with every stroke of charcoal bringing out the sharp contrasts and deep shadows that define the Joker’s unsettling features. The intense use of light and dark in this drawing adds to the dramatic tension, highlighting the madness behind the character's smile and eyes.<br><br>

            The texture of the charcoal pencil allows for a rich, gritty quality, giving the piece a raw, almost cinematic feel. The blending of charcoal creates soft transitions in the shadows, while the sharper lines add a sense of depth and definition to the Joker’s face, emphasizing the character's complex and unpredictable nature.<br><br>
            
            This drawing was an experiment in bringing a character known for his flamboyance and theatricality into a more serious, realistic light. It reflects my exploration of using traditional mediums like charcoal to convey emotional depth and drama in portraiture, and my personal interpretation of one of Gotham’s most notorious figures.

            This charcoal pencil drawing, created in the early days of my art journey in 2022, depicts a cute, small girl holding a baby dog. The piece captures the warmth and tenderness of the moment, with soft, delicate shading that highlights the innocence and pure connection between the child and the puppy. The use of charcoal allowed me to explore contrast and texture, especially in the softness of the girl's hair and the fluffiness of the puppy, which contrasts with the sharp lines of their faces, bringing the subjects to life.<br><br>

While still exploring my style, this drawing represents my first steps in portraiture and capturing emotion through simple, gentle expressions. The way the child cradles the puppy conveys a sense of love and protection, and the overall composition reflects my early fascination with creating emotional depth through traditional techniques.<br><br>

Though this piece was one of my first attempts at art, it holds significant sentimental value as it marks the beginning of my artistic journey and my exploration of capturing moments of affection and tenderness through drawing.
